<h2>SO this is a chat app made by me in PHP...</h2>
some things before setting it up ...

First of ALL.. Open <b>Config.php</b> and set up base_url as the path to root dir...
then create database for it and in <pre>./App</pre> folder import <pre>DATABASE_STRUC.sql</pre>...
Then give database details in<b>Config.php</b>
<h3>Done...Now run it and enjoy!</h3>
